## This is a data structures and algorithims Reporitory.

 It contains an overview of data structures such as Arrays, Objects,stacks and linkedlists and their basic operations.

 ### Big O
 >  Big O allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.

 **Time Complexity**

 We say that an algorithm is **O(f(n))** if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventally less than a constant times **f(n)**, as **n** increases.

* f(n) could be constant  **O(1)**
* f(n) could be linear **O(n)**
* f(n) could be quadratic **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
* f(n) could be something entirely different! **O(log n)** , **O(nlog n)** ,

**Big O Rules**
1. Arithmetic operations are constant.
2. Variable assignment is constant.
3. Accessing elements in an array(by index) or object(by key) is constant.
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop.

**Space Complexity**
