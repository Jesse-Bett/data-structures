## This is a data structures and algorithims Reporitory.

 It contains an overview of data structures such as Arrays, Objects,stacks and linkedlists and their basic operations.

 ### Big O
 >  Big O allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.

- We say that an algorithm is **O(f(n))** if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventally less than a constant times **f(n)**, as **n** increases.

* f(n) could be linear (f(n)=n)
* f(n) could be quadratic (f(n)=n^2^)
* f(n) could be constant (f(n)=1)
* f(n) could be something entirely different!
